							li Bet Log is a new way to keep track of bets with your friends.
							br
							li Create groups or join groups. Groups become central hubs where you can see the events that are being bet on in your group.
							br
							li To create an event, just enter the details of the event along with an event password. This password will be used later to select a winner for the event.
							br
							li By selecting an event, you can see who has bet on what option and for how much.
							br
							li Create bets by entering your name, wager, and cellphone number (optional, for text message alerts).
							br
							li Alternatively, you can match another bet from the events page by clicking on it.
							br
							li If you’re the one who created the event, you can select a winner using the event password.
							br
							li Once a winner is chosen, text messages are sent to all eligible betters specifying what they’ve won or lost.
